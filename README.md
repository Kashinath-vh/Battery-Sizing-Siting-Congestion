Abstract:

A method of optimal siting and sizing of the battery-based energy storage system (BESS) is presented in this paper. The BESS is installed with an objective to minimize the operating cost of the microgrid. The BESS site is chosen based on a new index proposed called Locational Economic Driving Force, which is based on locational marginal price (LMP). AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem is formulated and solved for a radial autonomous microgrid. The proposed ACOPF can calculate the components of LMP, such as energy, loss, and congestion. The proposed technique is applied to the 33-node microgrid, and a considerable reduction in net operating cost was achieved.
